# Study Stuff Backend [SSB]

A repository with all my study materials (focused on Java ☕️). Here you'll find links to books, articles and other study stuff that I'm using to increase aabilities of **Software Engineering**... 

I hope it helps another one who desires to do so.

## Sumary
1. [Books](#books)

## Books 📚

Read about technical content is always a good way to understand a little bit more how things work. Here are some books to help with programming language, algorithms and design patterns used on the world of **software engineering**
